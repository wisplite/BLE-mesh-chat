# ble_mesh_chat

This is a demo application for my BLE-mesh project. This is designed to connect to the websocket server example and provide an interface to send and receive messages on the mesh network. This is NOT the android app, this is for desktop use only.

At this moment I am not providing prebuilt releases, those will be provided when the mesh protocol is built and finalized on all platforms. For now, this is just a super simple flutter application, clone the repo and run `flutter run`.
